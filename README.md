# Scraping Instagram by Scraping Fish üêü

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial for scraping public Instagram profile information and posts using [Scraping Fish API](https://scrapingfish.com).
It is provided in the `instagram-tutorial` python notebook.
To be able to run it and actually scrape the data, you will need Scraping Fish API key which you can get here: [Scraping Fish Request Packs](https://scrapingfish.com/buy).
A starter pack of 1,000 API requests costs only $2 and will let run this tutorial and play with the API on your own ‚õπÔ∏è.
Without Scraping Fish API key you are likely to get blocked instantly ‚õîÔ∏è.

Scraping Fish is a premium API for scraping powered by rotating 4G/LTE proxy by default.
It is the best available proxy type for scraping since mobile IPs are ephemeral and constantly reassigned between real users.
This type of proxy is capable of scraping even the most demanding websites, like Instagram, without being blocked.
You can read more on advanced topics in Scraping Fish API [Documentation](https://scrapingfish.com/docs/intro).
